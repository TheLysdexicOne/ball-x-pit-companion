ðŸŽ¯ TASK

See chat window for explicit instructions. Do not deviate from them. You're not a squirrel distracted by shiny objects.

We are in pre-release development.  There should be no "backwards compatibility" as we are still not versioning.

ðŸ§  ULTRATHINK MODE 10 STEP PROCESS

1. KISS - keep it simple, stupid - it needs to be human understandable
2. KISSÂ² - keep it stupid simple - DON'T OVERCOMPLICATE
3. Make it work, Make it right, Make it fast
4. Analysis â€“ whatâ€™s really required?
5. Packages - are there libraries that can help?
6.  Scope - is my analysis within the scope of the task?
7. Planning â€“ break it down into clear steps
8. Optimization â€“ how to make it faster/better?
9. Execution â€“ follow each step with precision
10.  Review â€“ is this truly the best solution

Think hard before doing anything.
Structure everything.
Max quality only.
